Main idea of the Project
========================
With the development of agriculture technology, the greenhouse system plays a profound role in environmental modification allowing the growth of plants in different climatic conditions. In the present scenario, greenhouses generally make use of artificial means to monitor environmental factors. However, these techniques cause wastage of manpower and give inaccurate information regarding the environment. So, we have come up with a dynamic monitoring system for the greenhouse environment based on IoT. The proposed idea monitors factors like temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and light intensity. All these parameters are accessed by a user on a mobile app consisting of both manual and an automatic mode, via the cloud. Using the manual mode the user can alter the parameter thresholds and at the same time can also set values for the automatic mode. Hence, water pumps, heaters, coolers, and light sources are controlled to stabilize the greenhouse environment through greenhouse sensors and developed mobile applications.
